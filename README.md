Godot Game Jam [12-2016]

Godot Core is 2.2-alpha_custom build

You play a broken robot.  The idea is to beat the timer.  Abuse the bugs in the level as the game is build
that way.

Keys: 
a - d or left - right arrows: Move the player
space bar: Jump
e: use (to press buttons)
esc: To show menu (this is bugged so goodluck :P)
