**********
Extra ideas:
- Random placement of special items (time booster, speed booster, time altering)
- Possible idea for slow-to fast movement speed/momentum increase. (start moving semi slow and the longer
you run the faster you go)
$ Time booster: Increase time by x amount.
$ Speed booster: Increase character movement speed for x amount of time by x amount.
$ Time altering: Could give longer jumps.
$ Stats increase.
